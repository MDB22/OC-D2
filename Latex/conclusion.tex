Using our parallel design pipelines for both software and hardware, we have been able to achieve rapid results over the last year. Our hardware approach of continuous, iterative, small scale testing before implementation on the X8 has allowed us to achieve a functional prototype in a short time. Our software approach of development, validation in simulation, and real-world testing has allowed us to integrate our sensors, and test basic autonomous missions.\\

While we are still in development, and have several key subsystems to implement and test, we are happy with our current progress, and the safety checks and systems we have in place. Though other, more experienced teams have likely progressed further than we have, we are confident in our design and will continue to develop the best competitor possible.\\

Our immediate development tasks are to refine our flight termination system, and continue testing our transition system. Once that is complete, develop more robust computer vision software and implement our long range communications, and then all signs point to the UAV Challenge in September.\\
