\subsection{Mitigating Risks identified in Section \ref{sec:risk-assessment}}
This section addresses how the team will manage and mitigate the risks identified in Section \ref{sec:risk-management}. Continuing to follow the Risk Assessment template, the tables below will contain the following information in each row: the hazard (as identified previously), any control measures used to mitigate or manage the hazard, and the resultant risk rating, after implementing the control measures.\\
