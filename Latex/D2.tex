\textbf{All information is taken from pages 24 and on from the UAV Challenge Rules specification. Deliverable \#2 is to be a maximum of 23 pages.}\\

\textbf{In addition to this report, teams must submit a flight demonstration video. The video must demonstrate autonomous take-off and landing, and pre-flight set up and checks.}\\

Team submissions are assessed according to Figure \ref{fig:D2Scoring}.

\section{Tasks for Deliverable \#2}
Create a video that shows:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Pre-flight set up and checks
	\item Autonomous takeoff and landing of Retrieval Aircraft
\end{enumerate}

The report must demonstrate:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Aircraft must automatically engage their \textit{Flight Termination System} if they breach the Geofence
\end{enumerate}

To be added to the UAV (if possible):
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Backup power system
	\item External emergency stop button
	\item External arming switch and state indicator (LED)
\end{enumerate}

From the ``Go'' email:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item If you have a VTOL system, you need to ensure that you address the case of GPS failure during all modes of flight, especially hovering. How will you hover if you do not have GPS?
	\item Consider the potential for multiple failures and how certain combinations of failures may require flight termination.
	\item Please ensure that there is sufficient design information about your Flight Termination System in your D2 document so that the committee can confirm that it complies with the rules.
	\item You MUST ensure that any radio systems that you use are LEGAL in Australia (you MUST check this yourselves). You are not required to report the full details regarding your RF transmitters until D3, but you will not be given a Go decision at D3 if you are using illegal frequencies or illegal radiated power levels.
	\item Do not assume that aircraft will have reliable 3G or 4G mobile phone coverage during the mission. The mission may take place in an area of no, or poor mobile phone coverage.
\end{enumerate}
